Reproduction Steps:

Navigate to the vulnerable endpoint: https://www.spamhero.com/cp/account/account-contacts.

Add an account with billing permissions (this will be the attacker's account).

Log in with the attacker's account and verify that you don’t have access to the Team Management area.

Create a third account (attacker's second account) and use this account to add a with the function (user from another account). Intercept the request during this process.

In the intercepted request, observe that it contains an x-csrf-token header and cookies. You can obtain these values by updating the attacker's profile and noting the x-csrf-token and cookies.

Modify the intercepted request by replacing the x-csrf-token and cookies with the attacker's values. This will send a request to add a user from another account, using the attacker's session, despite the attacker only having billing permissions.

Finally, log in with the owner’s account, navigate to the Team Management area, and observe that a new user has been added with technical and billing access without proper authorization.
